# Project-4
Last part of class project with Project Group 5
CS 3321 – Software Engineering
Project Assignment 4 – Implementation and Testing
Due: 11/30/2021, 23:59
Submission: Submit your document and your source codes as a single .zip file through 
Blackboard. 
As the fourth and the final step of your term project, you will implement your project and test 
it. For implementation, you are free to use any programming language. You should start with 
implementing your design. However, if you need any change on your design, you are also free 
to change your class diagram and associated attributes and methods. At the end of the 
implementation, you will test your product and prepare a user documentation to explain how 
your software will be used. You are expected to submit your source codes with your report. On 
November 30 / December 1, each group will present their work in 10-15 minutes. 
All team members need to contribute to implementation. Therefore, you are expected to use a 
version control system such as Git or SVN to work as a team. You need to discuss your 
experience with version control system in Section 8.
In your implementation, you are expected to include prologue and inline comments in your 
codes. Prologue comments can include the name of the code artifact, a brief description of 
what the code artifact does, name of the team members who wrote the artifact, and the date 
the code artifact was coded. Inline comments should be used to explain non-obvious parts of 
code. You should apply good programming practices and avoid poor programming practices.
This document will be your final report. It will also contain the contents of the previous 
documents as explained in the following. If you changed any of the previous artifacts, include 
the updated ones in your final report. Therefore, your final report must be consistent such that 
all requirements should be satisfied, all use cases should be realized, and all classes in the class 
diagram should be implemented. Your report must contain the sections listed below. 
Style Guidelines: You can use Arial, Times New Roman, or Calibri fonts with font size 11/12pt. 
Line spacing should be at most 1.5. Paper size should be 8.5"x11" (Letter) and you should use 
“Normal” MS Word margins (1" top, bottom, right, and left margins.). 
1. Introduction
2. Functional Requirements
3. Use Cases
Copy these three sections from the requirements document (Assignment 1). Update them if 
you later changed your requirements or use cases. Highlight your updates.
4. Class Diagram
5. Statechart
6. Use Case Realization
7. Detailed Design
Copy these four sections from the specification and design documents (Assignment 2 & 3). 
Update them if you later changed your diagrams or design. Highlight your updates.
8. Implementation
In this section, you are expected to discuss your implementation details and experience. Your 
discussion should include the following topics.
 Selection of Programming Language and IDE. Why did you use such programming 
language and IDE?
 Programming Practices. Which programming practices were applied or avoided? For 
instance, did you use consistent and meaningful variable names?
 Reuse and Portability. Did you reuse any existing code? Which components of your 
codes can be reused in the future? Is your product portable? 
 Version Control System: Which version control system was used? What did you like or 
dislike? What features were the most useful to you? What features can also be added? 
9. Test Cases and Results
In execution-based testing, selecting test cases is an important problem in order to detect as 
much fault as possible within a reasonable time. The art of testing is to devise a small, 
manageable set of test cases to maximize the chances of detecting a fault while minimizing the 
chances of wasting a test case by having the same fault detected by more than one test case.
When you implement your design, you need to do unit testing, integration testing, and product 
testing. In these tests, you can use the test cases which can be determined using black-box and 
glass-box techniques. In black-box testing, you can determine your test cases using 
specifications. You can use “Equivalence Testing and Boundary Value Analysis” and “Functional 
Testing” techniques to determine test cases. In glass-box testing, you can determine your test 
cases based on your code. You can try to achieve statement coverage or branch coverage to 
execute every statement or every branch at least once. In this section, you will list all of your 
test cases, expected output for each test case, and observed output after your tests. 
10. User Documentation
When your product passes all tests, it is ready to be used by users. In this section, you will 
explain how your software can be installed and used by a user. Assume that you are delivering 
your product to the client. You should clearly explain how client can install the software and use 
the software. The user documentation should describe each feature of the program, and assists 
the user in realizing these features. If your product has several roles such as user and admin, 
you should provide documentation for each role.
